# d3-jsonstat-bar-chart
This is a (moderately) simple grouped bar chart. Once configured with data and
options, the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis (optionally for grouping) can be changed
at run-time and the chart redrawn to reflect changes.

Feedback on events is available for a range of interactions, and key elements of
the bar chart have CSS classes assigned to enable customisation.
